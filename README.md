 It's a WinForms app written in .NET Framework with some NodeJS. I deliberately choose WinForms technology because I wanted to have power over Windows features like notifications or lock screen. WPF app doesn't support timers as good as WinForms, so maybe technology is a bit outdated but suits my purposes very well! 

If you want to run this app please download whole project and run Pomodoro App.exe file from "./Pomodoro App/bin/Debug" relative path

#Additional notes:
1) This applications requires some permissions or software to run: 
 a) NodeJS installed on PC in order to run ChatGPT
 b) If you want to make use of chatGPT go to: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys and generate API key and paste it to ./chatGPT/.env file
 b) Admin rights to change etc/hosts files to block websites

2) Currently this app doesn't support playing music because these files are too large to store in repository
